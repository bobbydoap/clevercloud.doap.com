Hi Lance,

It was great speaking with you today!  Lets get your online presence into sh=
ape.  It's really a painless process once we work out what you need.

Here's what i propose:

1yr full package w/ advertising option

We will work with you, supplying all the coding and graphics work needed to g=
et your 5 page site in a state that you are happy with.  The process goes so=
mething like this...
We  introduce you to the wordpress content management system and get you com=
fortable enought to select a theme that looks appealing to you. (its easy, j=
ust need to know what you like..)
I will use the new theme and your existing landing page to create a nice 5 p=
age site with easy to use menus and management tools drawing from existing H=
VAC sites. =20
Next i get your feedback for revision, graphics, page titles, service areas,=
 fonts, background colors, meta tags for your geographic target areas, keywo=
rds, etc will get tweaked in this phase.
We will also craft nice seasonal landing pages (summer winter) with eye-catc=
hing ads which you can swap out as needed per your recommendations:  http://=
airandplumbing.gets-it.net/
When you are happy with the everything (at this point the new site will be a=
tbahp.thehvac.net), we will handle your bahp.com DNS switchover to our cloud=
 based web host.  You will need to provide registrar credentials for us to d=
o this transfer for you...
If you opt for advertising, we now get to turn on the ad campaign!  Minimum r=
ecommended is $200/mo.  Best would be around $600/mo.  None is actually nece=
ssary but highly recommended and you can cancel anytime.
The service I'm recommending is a full service package from The HVAC Network=
.  Setup costs $1000 and gets you all your hosting and 24/7 support for a ye=
ar.  Advertising costs will be billed monthly as employed.

The basic deal:
core site setup with up to 10hrs custom work.
24/7 support for a year.
hosting for a year.
build 2 seasonal (summer/winter) landing pages optimized for google adwords
google adwords ad campaign setup
bi-monthly ad campaign tuning for a year (normally $200/mo!)
keyword and service area meta tag optimization for your entire site and land=
ing pages
google map with driving directions on your site
appointment scheduling tool on website
dns transfer services
site monitoring
tools (and training) for you to easily update the content on any of your sit=
es pages via the content management system.
Google analytics configuration
The HVAC.Net Premire dealer listing  gets free national exposure.
TheHVAC.Net  Dealer locator preferred dealer listing.
Subsequent years are billed at a flat rate of $200 which covers hosting and s=
upport.  Graphics and programming will be billed at a metered rate of $50/hr=
.  Advertising is always pay as you go and is a more fluid process.

Give me a call and we can discuss the options and also share a screen and go=
 over some samples.  We are completely flexible and can tailor the program i=
n whatever way works best for you.

i can be reached at 805-426-5216

Cheers!
