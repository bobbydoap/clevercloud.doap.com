<br>
Thank you for your reply. After investigating this issue further I can see that you do have users on your <a href="http://myworldtransfers.com/" target="_blank">myworldtransfers.com</a> account. As you suggested, you can use <a href="mailto:dmenache@doap.com">dmenache@doap.com</a> as a user but just to advise David that this user is set-up to your secondary account and therefore you will not be able to access the Control Panel.<br>

<br>
What I would suggest is that I provide you with access to an existing user Account with a <a href="http://myworldtransfer.com/" target="_blank">myworldtransfer.com</a> address which will allow you to access the Control Panel, but in order for me to do this I must firstly ask you to verify that your are the owner of the domain. You can verify this by doing either of the following :<br>

<br>
Verification Option #1: Create a special CNAME record<br>
1. Create the following CNAME record for your domain through your domain hosting provider:[ticket number found in the subject of the email from Google] points to <a href="http://ghs.google.com/" target="_blank">ghs.google.com</a><br>

*Example: 21779401 points to <a href="http://ghs.google.com/" target="_blank">ghs.google.com</a>*<br>
2. If your domain host is separate from your domain registrar, make sure you're modifying the CNAME record with your domain host. For help creating this CNAME record, follow the CNAME instructions at <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=47283" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=47283</a><br>

<br>
Verification Option #2: Upload a special HTML file<br>
1. Create an HTML file and name it gafyd.html.<br>
2. Enter the following characters anywhere in the HTML file: [ticket number found in the subject of the email from Google. *Example: 21779401*<br>
3. Save and upload this HTML file to your website. Be sure to upload the file to your root directory.<br>
4. Check <a href="http://your-domain.com/gafyd.html" target="_blank">http://your-domain.com/gafyd.html</a> to make sure the file was uploaded properly.<br>
Note: Your extension may vary (e.g. .com, .net, .org). Be sure to replace '<a href="http://your_domain.com/" target="_blank">your_domain.com</a>' with your actual domain name.<br>
<br>
Once you've completed one of the verification options, reply to this message and I'll be happy to assist you further.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Thank you for your message. My name is Cian and I will be assisting you<br>

&gt; the Control Panel for the domain <a href="http://doap.com/" target="_blank">doap.com</a>. Unfortunately because this<br>
&gt; domain is set up as a secondary domain it is expected behaviour that you<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; To confirm David, <a href="http://myworldtransfers.com/" target="_blank">myworldtransfers.com</a> is set-up as your primary domain<br>
&gt; and <a href="http://doap.com/" target="_blank">doap.com</a> &nbsp;is set-up as your secondary domain. This means that doap.cominherits the settings from that are configured for your primary domain. I<br>
