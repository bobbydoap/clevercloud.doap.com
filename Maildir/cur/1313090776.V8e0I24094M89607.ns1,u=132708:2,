Hi Lance=2C
It was great speaking with you today!  Lets get your online presence into s=
hape.  It's really a painless process once we work out what you need.

Here's what i propose:

1yr full package w/ advertising option

includes:We will work with you=2C supplying all the coding and graphics wor=
k needed to get your 5 page site in a state that you are happy with.  The p=
rocess goes something like this...

We  introduce you to the wordpress content management system and get you co=
mfortable enought to select a theme that looks appealing to you. (its easy=
=2C just need to know what you like..)
I will use the new theme and your existing landing page to create a nice 5 =
page site with easy to use menus and management tools drawing from existing=
 HVAC sites.  Next i get your feedback for revision=2C graphics=2C page tit=
les=2C service areas=2C fonts=2C background colors=2C meta tags for your ge=
ographic target areas=2C keywords=2C etc will get tweaked in this phase.
We will also craft nice seasonal landing pages (summer winter) with eye-cat=
ching ads which you can swap out as needed per your recommendations:  http:=
//airandplumbing.gets-it.net/
When you are happy with the everything (at this point the new site will be =
at bahp.thehvac.net)=2C we will handle your bahp.com DNS switchover to our =
cloud based web host.  You will need to provide registrar credentials for u=
s to do this transfer for you...
If you opt for advertising=2C we now get to turn on the ad campaign!  Minim=
um recommended is $200/mo.  Best would be around $600/mo.  None is actually=
 necessary but highly recommended and you can cancel anytime.

The service I'm recommending is a full service package from The HVAC Networ=
k.  Setup costs $1000 and gets you all your hosting and 24/7 support for a =
year.  Advertising costs will be billed monthly as employed.


The basic deal:

core site setup with up to 10hrs custom work.24/7 support for a year.hostin=
g for a year.build 2 seasonal (summer/winter) landing pages optimized for g=
oogle adwords
google adwords ad campaign setupbi-monthly ad campaign tuning for a year (n=
ormally $200/mo!)keyword and service area meta tag optimization for your en=
tire site and landing pagesgoogle map with driving directions on your site
appointment scheduling tool on websitedns transfer servicessite monitoringt=
ools (and training) for you to easily update the content on any of your sit=
es pages via the content management system.

Subsequent years are billed at a flat rate of $200 which covers hosting and=
 support.  Graphics and programming will be billed at a metered rate of $50=
/hr.  Advertising is always pay as you go and is a more fluid process.

Give me a call and we can discuss the options and also share a screen and g=
o over some samples.  We are completely flexible and can tailor the program=
 in whatever way works best for you.
