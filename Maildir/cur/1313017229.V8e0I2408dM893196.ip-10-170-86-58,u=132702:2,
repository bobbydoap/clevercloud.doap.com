Hi Everyone,

Here are the stats on the Google Ads campaign for Laura's Ruud project in So
Cal. so far:

*July 19- August 8*

   - 148,000 Impressions or ad views


   - 440 Clicks on our ads


   - 62 sales calls to one of our dealers - 57 of them unique callers.

Here's the list of hot prospects Dave was referrng to:

GP Plumbing and Air  Yorba Linda
Moreflow A/C   Sylmar,
Landeen HVAC Simi Valley
MBA Mechanical Simi Valley
Indoor Comfort Control Simi Valley
Pinnacle Aire  Oxnard
Alliance Air Northridge
ABC Air Conditioning Sun Valley


The two things each one has in common is that they are part of the Ruud
campaign AND none of them have a website.
I thought everyone had a website. I'm quickly learning that there's a lot
more opportunity out there than I realized.
So far GP Plumbing and Air  has expressed interest and I'm in the process of
calling on the rest.

Its a lot of  fun to see doap.com beginning to develop.   Talk to you all
tonight!
