Big Data Hackathon at SPLASH/OOPSLA (Portland, October 2011)

Posted: 28 Sep 2011 10:43 AM PDT
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~3/CbG_JvICNYM/big-data-hackathon-at-splashoopsla-portland-october-2011.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email


Ill be running a Big Data Hackathon at the SPLASH/OOPSLA Conference in  
Portland, Oregon next month.

Hackathons are participatory event. You dont show up to watch or to hang  
out; you show up to lead or to join a team of other developers to imagine,  
create, and build something cool and useful in the course of a single day.  
This may sound impossibly ambitious. It is not. You can get a lot done when  
you can ignore your inbox and simply focus on the task at hand. The ability  
to tap in to high-level services certainly helps, as does the fact that  
everyone shows up expecting to work.

Well hack from 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM on Sunday, October 23rd. The day will be  
structured as follows:

Introduction, welcome and agenda
Short sponsor talks.
Idea pitches from the audience.
Team formation.
Hacking.
Team presentations.
Judging.


This particular hackathon will be focused on the concept of "Big Data."  
Think about taking Columbia Universitys 500 GB Million Song Dataset  
(conveniently available as an AWS Public Data Set) and doing something  
interesting with it, such as finding songs that slowly build in intensity.  
What could you do with a collection of 250,000 Material Safety Data Sheets,  
some economics data, some gene sequences, a US census, or 80 years of daily  
global weather measurements?

Attendees are free to use the technology and data sets of their choice. I  
will be supplying the teams with some AWS usage credits to make it easy to  
use EC2, Elastic MapReduce, and our other services.

If this sounds like a great way to spend a Sunday, then you need to do the  
following:

Sign up for the Hackathon. Space is limited, but we still have a few seats  
left.
Start thinking about what you would like to build and how you would like to  
pitch it.
Consider signing up for an AWS account.
Show up and have a great time.


I am also looking for an additional sponsor or two. The ideal sponsor would  
have a product or service that would be of interest to someone who is  
working with Big Data. Please get in touch with me (email to  
awseditor@amazon.com) and we can discuss the details.

I hope to see you in Portland next month!
