Hi Pat,

It's coming right along.  I think you'll be really happy.  You are right, it
is a big job with lots of moving pieces.  We have a new globalhvac.net user
list built with default passwords for all 2500 customers and a framework for
them to log in with price levels.  I'm ready for product lists beyond the
test list ya gave me.  The limited lists arent sufficient to get the front
end paging properly.  Also, I noticed there are no prices.  I'm suspecting
there is a table with columns similar to (SKU, PRICE, STORE_ID)  ...I just
made these up as an example.  The previous exports you sent me were great
and you really seem to know whats going on with this stuff so I have
complete confidence.   Oh, if the files are too big to mail, i have an
amazon globalhvac.net bucket that can handle up to 4TB files!  Ok cheers,
thanks for the help.

Dave
