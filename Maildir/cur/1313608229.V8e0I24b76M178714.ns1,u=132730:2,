Jon,

Regarding Southern California Ruud ad campaigns...

A web accessible account balance report is needed. Google doc?  We will use t=
hat to determine what is left in their budget.  With this info, we will go t=
o Ruud(Specialty AC) and explain the campaign is setup and about to be enabl=
ed in a big way.  If the traffic comes it comes, if not then not and we can t=
hink of other ways to use their ad $$ to drive traffic such as paid placemen=
ts or other ad networks, etc.

Here are a couple of links.  First is the campaign list.  Second is a report=
 on the recently optimized campaigns with keyword structures, ads as they wi=
ll appear on google, and cost per keyword which we will explained to them:

http://www.thehvac.net/ruud-socal/=20

The big deal here is that we will let them know that we are going to max the=
 bids and run it till the money runs out so watch the phones carefully as we=
 dump hundreds a day into it for a very short time...  If they are happy wit=
h the results, they will refund it.
