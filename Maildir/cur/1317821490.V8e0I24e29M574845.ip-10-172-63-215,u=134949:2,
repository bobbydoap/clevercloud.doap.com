Good morning,

When I did a Google search for "Los angeles air conditioning", your web sit=
e showed up in a sponsored ad.

You would get a lot more exposure to potential clients if you showed up hig=
her organically.

As you can imagine, natural listings get much more traffic than sponsored a=
ds.

They are also trusted more, so the traffic turns into new clients more ofte=
n, with unlimited clicks and lower costs less than sponsored ads.

I can help you get your web site to show up organically in Google & other s=
earch engines.

There are thousands of searches for your services every month. That's a lot=
 of potential business.

I can also help you with:

-Mobile marketing
-Content writing
-Link building
-Sponsored ads
-Social media
-Blogging

And more ...

Is there a good time this week to give you a call to discuss positioning Ca=
nyoncountryac.does-it organically?

Or call me any time.

Warmest regards,
