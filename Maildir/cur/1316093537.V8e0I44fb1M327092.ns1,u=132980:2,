> Over the summer months, we'd like to share a few stories from startups aro=
und the world: what are they working on and how they are using the cloud to g=
et things done. Today, we're profiling Classle, from Chennai, India!
>=20
>=20
>=20
> I recently read Mark Suster=E2=80=99s blog on Avoiding Monoculture - which=
 is why I=E2=80=99m happy to share with you what I=E2=80=99ve learned about C=
lassle, a  startup from India, focused on solving education problems for are=
as of the world that experience serious resource constraints. Classle has th=
e big goal of changing the world around them by encouraging students and exp=
erts to share knowledge and expertise, and using the AWS cloud to facilitate=
 this exchange.=20

> I reached out to Vaidya Nathan, Founder and CEO of Classle:
>=20
> About Classle
> Classle is a Social Learning infrastructure company with specific focus on=
 Education, Learning and Knowledge communities. Using the main Classle produ=
ct, Cloud Campus platform, Classle creates and manages private and public so=
cial learning environments and offers services based on it.
>=20
>=20
> Classle helps rural students access higher education and reach opportuniti=
es unavailable before. Our company partners with a wide network of colleges t=
hroughout India, which act as internet-connected "learning nodes" that distr=
ibute educational materials to students. When the student goes home for the d=
ay with their downloaded lectures and other materials from the library, Clas=
sle makes use of mobile technology and SMS-based quizzes to keep students en=
gaged and actively learning. The entire system was designed to work with sim=
ple, $10 phones, not smartphones, and the students are entirely addicted to t=
hese quizzes - they can=E2=80=99t get enough of them.
>=20
> All these services are provided free of charge to both students and colleg=
es. Classle monetizes by partnering with companies who are looking to hire t=
op talent from among the students, and by selling their cloud-based learning=
 platform for training purposes within companies.
>=20
> Starting Small and Growing with Business
> We are using AWS since our inception in early 2009. Our first steps involv=
ed two small Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS to store our database. Over=
 the years, our use has expanded to match our business growth. Our selection=
 criteria covered tactical as well as strategic points. =46rom a tactical pe=
rspective, we wanted a quicker time for provisioning, which AWS on-demand in=
stances enabled, and the option to secure our resource needs through Reserve=
d Instances.
>=20
> At a strategic level, we wanted to provide the best experience for our cus=
tomers and it was key to build Classle on top of services, products, and inf=
rastructure designed for growth and scale. To date, we have established rela=
tionships with over 30 educational organizations and that list is constantly=
 growing. Thanks to AWS, we are effectively competing with some large and st=
rong players in the e-learning space.
>=20
> Sharing the AWS Lessons:
>=20
> We are a small, LAMP stack team and we started using AWS in 2009. Currentl=
y, the products we are using are below. For reference, we are also happy to s=
hare our Classle architecture diagram, which is included in our case study w=
ith AWS.

an test your ideas and run a business at very low cost.

> Being from in India, where we don=E2=80=99t have a strong start-up mentali=
