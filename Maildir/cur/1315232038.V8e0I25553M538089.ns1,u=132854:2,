Comment: 
We know z-index range is -100 through 100

We set the canvas z-index to 10 and it shows up underneath the menu and above the container page and other elements.  Our job is to find the CSS id's for the elements currently hidden and set their z-index to something higher than 10.

When you find the page id's, let me know here!
Suerte!
