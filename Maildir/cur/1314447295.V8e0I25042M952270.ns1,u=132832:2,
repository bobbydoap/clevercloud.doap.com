AWS Summer Startups: Appscend

Posted: 26 Aug 2011 08:16 AM PDT
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~3/R4xvCPo3bUo/aws-summer-startups-appscend.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email




Over the summer months, we'd like to share a few stories from startups  
around the world: what are they working on and how they are using the cloud  
to get things done. Today, we're profiling Appscend, from Bucharest,  
Romania!




Appscend is a sign that catching the "startup bug" and being able to run a  
high-tech company is possible waay outside Silicon Valley, in Romania,  
where startups don't have the benefit of tapping into a support system and  
extensive mentorship. I spoke to Gabi Dobocan, Appscend Cofounder, who was  
quick to tell me that his small team enjoys the challenge and is eager to  
work at least 10 times as hard as their counterparts in other countries in  
order to compete. To date, they have received support from local angel  
investor and mentor, Peter Barta, and from an extended entrepreneur network  
from Western Europe. We wish Gabi and his team the best of luck :)

About Appscend

Appscend is "Wordpress for mobile" software. Since day one, the vision for  
Appscend was to create a robust, highly customizable product that can  
produce feature-rich mobile apps in record time. Today, a few months after  
launch, Appscend has enlisted over 400 registered users working on about  
300 mobile apps. Among these customers, Appscend works with Domo, one of  
the largest local retailers, the Romanian National Television, and a couple  
of important local publishers. Appscend currently supports iOS apps and  
their development team is working on releasing an Android version in the  
next few months.
"100% AWSomeness"
Appscend offers a series of products geared at enabling our customers to  
build rich mobile apps apps using an intuitive, customizable interface. Our  
target audience is made up of digital publishers and agencies, so our  
products need to be easy to use and offer a wide array of functionality: we  
offer a mobile CMS, accessible for anyone that doesn't have a way to host  
their content elsewhere and have made it easy for users to import and  
export content. We help customers who build their mobile apps through  
Appscend track social activity around their content and we also offer them  
the ability to implement in-app purchases. In addition, to help our  
customers further monetize their mobile apps, we have enabled them to  
display ads inside their apps through an ad management server.
To build all these products, we use most of the cloud web services provided  
by Amazon Web Services and are delighted to call our implementation 100%  
AWSomeness.


Amazon S3 buckets are used for storing all the multimedia content used in  
the apps, optimized for mobile consumption.
The S3 buckets are connected to a Amazon CloudFront distribution to insure  
minimum latency wherever our clients' end-users are located.
Our customer dashboard, as well as all background processes, are hosted on  
Amazon EC2 instances.
The Amazon EC2 instances are placed into Elastic Load Balancers, so that we  
can enable auto-scaling through Amazon CloudWatch when needed.
Our ad server is based on Google Adwhirl and is hosted on an Amazon EC2  
instance.
The software connects to Amazon SimpleDB domains that hold information  
regarding to the apps and statistics.
Everything is powered by a MySQL 5 Enterprise server hosted on an Amazon  
RDS instance. We find it a good solution because we can scale very easily  
and the performance provided is excellent.

Finally, we keep in touch with our clients by sending email messages  
through Amazon SES, and we've also configured email alerts for our  
operators using the same service. In the future, we will look at  
implementing AWS CloudFormation in order to be able to provision resources  
as quickly as possible.



On Building a Startup in Romania and the Mobile Market

Right now, we're living our dream and working on our passion. It's really  
what makes us happy, what makes us grow, and at the end of the (12 hour  
working) day, that's all that matters. We survive, we take nothing for  
granted, and we do good with limited resources.
The mobile market is really still a young, fragmented market and we work  
hard to always be alert, listen and learn as much as we can. We're probably  
gonna change a lot of this product in the next year, and we welcome that :)  
Challenging your own beliefs and being flexible and open-minded is the only  
real way to evolve I think - as a company and as a person.
