you to Bobby Damery, a very clever developer who works closely with us.  =
He's really gung ho on adwords and does great stuff.  He and i discussed =
your setup  and agree that we have enough to press on. We've been =
talking to Laura and she assures us the money is there.   So, Bobby has =
already created a large pool of relevant keywords that match your site =
and the accompanying ad text.  This all has to match along with your =
site meta tags to really work well.  He completely gets rocket theme and =
gantry as well and wants to do some optimizing.  We want to update =
keywords and meta tags in the pages that are relevant like rigid and =
flex duct duct and others if you want, just forward us the basic text =
and we'll use creative license to set it up on your site, you review, =
suggest changes etc.  I need to get you two on the phone so he can give =
ya a rundown.  mind if i have him give you a ring directly?
