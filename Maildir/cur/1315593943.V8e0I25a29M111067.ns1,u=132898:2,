Hi=2C I'm David Menache from The HVAC Network=20
thehvac.net  I am trying to get your airandplumbing.com site to also be=20
available at www.airandplumbing.com =20

There are three ways to do it.  (to include mail only #2 will work)  It is =
$5/per year for each email or list. =20

So for example

mark@airandplumbing.com -> you@hotmail.com
joe@airandplumbing.com -> joe@hotmail
employee1@airandplumbing.com -> emp1@x.cm
employee2@airandplumbing.com -> emp2@y.com
employee3@airandplumbing.com -> emp3@z.com

info@airandplumbing.com -> mark@airandplumbing.com=2C joe@airandplumbing.co=
m=2C employee1@airandplumbing.com=2C etc....

So $30 for the year.  Handling a DNS switchover takes some human time so i =
need to charge you something for it.   I'm not sure if you've already been =
billed.  I will need to look=2C but DNS switchover and new setup is usually=
 $100.  I'm cc'ing jon so he can clarify that point.

Please have your guy send the info so we can get it setup correctly asap

1=2C  Add an A record for www.airandplumbing.com
 to 50.18.110.179 for your existing DNS provider. =20

2.  Change your name=20
servers to point to ns1.doap.com and ns2.doap.com and we will provide=20
dns hosting services and management for all of your domain names and=20
email going forward=2C or=20

3. update the home page on your current host to=20
use a redirect in the header of your home page. =20
Put this tag in your=20
index.html in your www.airandplumbing.com site <meta http-equiv=3D"refresh"=
 content=3D"0=3Burl=3Dhttp://airandplumbing.com">
  That will send visitors to the right page.  If you give me the login=20
info to your existing site or DNS provider i will do whichever one you=20
like.  Also=2C if you go with opt 2=2C we can create  your email accounts=20
for you
