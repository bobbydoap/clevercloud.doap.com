Dear bobby,

Thank you so much for your help.  Now you can see why a little bit of  
programming knowledge is a bad thing - it took me to places I  
shouldn't have gone!  I am very good with graphics , but terrible with  
code.  Thank you for getting me up and running.  I will paste the  
content in tomorrow - if you can help with one other small detail.  I  
cannot log in!  When I go to the wordpress.doap.com page and enter  
kelly and the password as kelly, I get nothing!  If I click on  
Wordpress, it takes me to the Install Wordpress Page, which I have  
already done several times and I am afraid that if I do it again, I  
might delete everything that has been created!


Can you please tell me how to log into my site?  Thank you so much.

gracias,

Kelly
