Hello,

We've noticed that at least one of your campaigns frequently reaches its
daily budget. As a result, your ads are not receiving 54% of their eligible
impressions. To see a complete analysis or to change your daily budget,
visit
https://adwords.google.com/o/Opportunities/Explorer?opportunityType=BUDGET&campaignId=70026675.


Increasing your budget could allow your ads to show more often and get more
clicks. For example, in Glendora Cypress, you met your daily budget of
$100.00 on 1 of the last 15 days. Increasing your budget to the recommended
amount of $235.00 would allow your ads to show more often and get
significantly more clicks per month.

If you have any questions, contact us at
https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/request.py?hl=en. We look forward to
providing you with the most effective advertising available.

Sincerely,

The Google AdWords team
