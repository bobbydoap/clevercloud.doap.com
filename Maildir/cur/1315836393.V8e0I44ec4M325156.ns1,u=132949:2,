Hi Dave,

It's best to make sure your geographic areas don't overlap so that your
ads don't compete against each other. However, your overlapping area
shouldn't impact the explanation I gave last week about the Ad Preview
tool and the competitive nature of the keyword 'airconditioning services
costa mesa.'

I hope that helps, and good luck to you!


Sincerely,

Vicki C.
