Hello,

We have cancelled your Google AdWords account at your request. Please note  
that if your account has any balance outstanding, you will be billed by our  
system within 60 days. Your credit card and billing information will not be  
stored and will only be used to conclude billing for services rendered  
through the date of cancellation.

You will be able to reactivate your account easily at any time in the  
future. To do so:

1. Log into AdWords with the email address and password previously  
associated with your account. If you cannot remember your password, click  
the 'Forgot your password?' link beneath the login button. Follow the  
instructions provided to access your account via a one-use URL.
2. A message box will appear at the top of your account. This message will  
explain your account's cancelled status.
3. Click 'Start reactivation process' at the bottom of the message box to  
continue.
4. Review any instructions relevant to your account payment method. (For  
example, if you are a credit card customer, you will be prompted to submit  
your billing information.) Please make sure to verify that all fields are  
correct.
5. When you have finished with the process, submit the requested payment  
information to reactivate your account.

We hope that you consider re-joining the program at your convenience. If  
you have any feedback or questions regarding the AdWords program, please
