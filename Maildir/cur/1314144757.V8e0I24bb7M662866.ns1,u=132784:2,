Two things I notice:

Instead of
*Be part of our privileged costumers and get the best rates
in maintenance and pool construction in ALL Nicaragua!*

suggestion:
*Join our family of preferred clients and enjoy the best service rates the
finest new pool construction in ALL Nicaragua!*

Although I am happy that you thought enough of us to include our pool, it's

one (Pic #2) with one that shows better. The other pictures are really nice.

That's my two  cents,

Jon
