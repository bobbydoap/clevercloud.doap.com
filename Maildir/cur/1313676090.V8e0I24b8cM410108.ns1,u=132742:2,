We need to collect the other 2 $500 payments from these guys.  Actually I'm n=
ot sure if the first payment cleared....  Anyway, to collect we need to fini=
sh up their site.  The point person on this is a guy named Mark Fisher?  Wro=
ng last name.  He has an account on thehvac.net but he doesn't know it yet. =
 teresa will get us connected with him.

What we need to do is reconnect with him and engage him in the design proces=
s.  I think bobby will be wonderful for this job with my supervision and hel=
p with the execution.   I've already interviewed Mark and know about some of=
 the desired changes.  Let's add what we can first before talking to him.

During the interfacing period with mark, we need to get him introduced to th=
ehvac.net dealer locator and all the ghvac sites and if possible get his mai=
l forwarding to him, and a home run would be introduce ing him to docs, chat=
, calendar functions...

It will be a big deal to win this guy over.  Major account exec.
