Mark,

How many email accounts do you want to have.
As Dave had mentioned they are inexpensive $5/year per account.
I imagine you want yours to be mark@airandplumbing.com. What other accounts
would
you like us to make for you?

We will remove the summer flyer now. You mentioned having the winter flyer
up next week.
We can do it for you or like you requested we can show you how to make the
adjustments
yourself.
