Hi Larry,

Good chat yesterday=85   =20

To follow up,  I believe that your new parts locator tools which i =
introduced you to yesterday ought to integrated with your live inventory =
so customers can check availability per warehouse and also not be =
bothered with items not offered and also see if backordering is =
necessary, also, of course, up to the minute pricing for all items =
including commodity based stuff, shopping cart, order processing, =
invoicing, etc.

I need to review your current systems so we know exactly what needs to =
be done to make things sync.   After that 'sync' is functioning, the =
rest of the bits like shopping cart functions are relatively easy to get =
going.   Before end of year launch target is perfectly reasonable if we =
get the bureaucratic stuff out of the way.

I know we've got to figure out how to compensate us for all of this and =
I appreciate your desire to be fair to all involved.   Also, the last =
thing i want is for you to feel 'gouged'.   We're in the process of =
trying to get bids from competitors now just to get a better idea of the =
market for this type of project.  As you know,  it is a huge job with =
lots of moving parts and without knowing for sure just yet, i am =
guessing the estimates will probably be approaching six figures.   I =
understand those kinds of prices are non-starters for you and i'm trying =
to figure out other ways to get it done for significantly less.  Just =
getting the competitor quotes is a difficult task  considering it takes =
quite technical people who understand this stuff to spend the time to =
fully understand the job so it can be properly bid.   =20


Would you guys be interested in paying a fee per transaction to avoid =
the headaches of managing  a system as complex as this?  You would still =
own the platform.   I would be an intermediary for all internet based =
sales and assume responsibility for all aspects of database =
administration, website development and maintenance, transaction flow =
and reporting back into your existing systems in exchange for some =
agreed upon service charge per online sale?    Ideally the fee would =
also take care of all hosting and ongoing maintenance of which there =
will always be a need.  (likely $300-$500/mo just for hosting plus =
developer time for system changes)  I could also be responsible for =
customer service during the order process and would staff a call center =
just for this.  Of course, figuring out what kind of per transaction fee =
is appropriate will be about as tricky as bidding the entire project.    =
If the agreed upon fee ended up not covering costs, we'd have to adjust. =
 It's really tricky to estimate without concrete info about sales.  =20

One thing I'm sure of, with 2500 dealer customers, hundreds of thousands =
of potential retail customers, and a parts database of half a million =
items, this is an enormous job with huge upside potential.  I'm really =
anxious to get this implemented!

These are just some initial thoughts.   I'm open to ideas and will let =
ya know what the quote hunting leads to.  Hopefully, you guys can do the =
same and we can compare notes.     As always, being completely fair, =
open, and straightforward with you guys is extremely important to me. =20=


Oh one more thing, I just got off the phone with Laura, she suggested =
that we bill you for the 'GOPERT' Parts Locator tools that have been =
deployed on your website.  We've got 40 hrs. into it.  20 sr. developer =
hrs, and 20 junior developer hrs.

We've delivered the parts database with sign on functions, unique =
passwords, automated password recovery functions,  and unique price =
levels for all 2500 dealers.  There are also  parts locator tools =
embedded in each of the primary websites: globalhvac.net, =
ghvac-sylmar.com, ghvac-manetca.com, ghvac-orange.com =
ghvac-employees.com, ghvac-dealers.com.  We've also built an admin area =
for employees to browse prices per customer as you saw yesterday.  I =
think it is pretty well good to go.=20

Here are our costs for that project.
20 * 80/hr
20 * 50/hr
Balance due: $2600

If it all looks good, I'd like to send an invoice for this work.  I =
understand if we agree on some kind of a fee based system I would be =
responsible for these kinds of development costs going forward.=20

Thanks
