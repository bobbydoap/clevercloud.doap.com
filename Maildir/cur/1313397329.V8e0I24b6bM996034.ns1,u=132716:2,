hey karl=2C =20

its late and i'm not sure where to begin....  i just got back a few hrs ago=
 and have been poking around since.  i'm pretty sure i know what happened n=
ow.   im having some growing pains with this cloud hosting stuff.  last wee=
k i had removed what i thought were snapshots but they were actual system v=
olumes and it took down your server.  i dont think it was down for long at =
all thanks to the roll-over to your trane page...  there might have been so=
me time where www wasnt accessible :(   i realize that is completely unacce=
ptable for any account=2C especially one that is doing paid advertising.  I=
 will redouble my efforts to ensure your uptime even if i have to put your =
stuff back on godaddy.  i gotta go get some rest but i will have all of thi=
s pointing to the right places first thing in the morning.

thanks
