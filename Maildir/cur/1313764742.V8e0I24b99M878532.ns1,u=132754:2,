"If you ain't first, you're last."=20
- Ricky Bobby, Talladega Nights=20

Why Being #1 is Important=20

Before we jump into the reasons your website is not ranked number one, let's=
 remind ourselves why it is important in the first place. If there are 100 s=
earches made by homeowners needing heating or air conditioning repair servic=
e, 60 of them will click the first website in the organic section.=20

It is that simple - the highest, organic ranked website gets the traffic.=20=


How SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Works=20

Let's simplify the search engine mystery. Search engines try to find website=
s that are most relevant to the words being searched by a person. Search eng=
ines scan your website and remember the words that are on each page. If the w=
ords on your website match the words being searched, then you have a good ch=
ance of your website being on the search results list (this is called on-pag=
e optimization). Equally important, if other websites link to your website, w=
hile mentioning those same words, then you will rank even higher (this is ca=
lled off-page optimization).=20

Focus on the Popular Words=20

The first step is to determine what words people are actually using to find y=
our service. I will help you - "ac repair" - is one very popular search term=
 for HVAC contractors. Therefore, if the company optimizing your website has=
 not focused on the words "ac repair" then your website is missing the boat.=
 This is the problem with not working with a company that is industry specif=
ic.=20

Not Enough Keywords=20

The real challenge is it is impossible to pick one word or phrase that cover=
s everything a HVAC contractor does. People use many different search terms,=
 e.g. "AC Repair Houston", "Air Conditioning Contractor", etc. An optimal SE=
O strategy would ensure that your website is optimized for between five and t=
en key phrases (long tail keywords).=20

Not Just Your Company Name=20

I have had several HVAC contractors tell me that their website is optimized b=
ecause when you searched on their name they came up first. Well, I would hop=
e so. This is the first litmus test - if your website is not #1 for your com=
pany name, your website was not designed correctly. However, that aside, how=
 do new customers, people that don't know your name, find you? Your website h=
as to be optimized for the services and products they want.=20

Confusing SEM with SEO=20

SEM means Search Engine Marketing and SEO stands for Search Engine Optimizat=
ion. Only 35% of potential clients will click on the Google Ads - SEM. The r=
est will click on the Organic search - SEO. With SEM, once you stop paying f=
or advertising your website will no longer appear. Too many HVAC contractors=
 mistake SEM for SEO and then wonder why their website is not found when the=
 advertising campaign ends.=20

What the Heck is Off-Page Optimization?=20

Most HVAC contractors neglect the importance of links from other websites es=
pecially when the link to their website references the keyword being searche=
d. In fact, on some search engines, this is even more important than if the w=
ebsite is optimized for the words being searched! There are good ways to bui=
ld these links (White Hat) and bad ways (Black Hat). Seek out companies that=
 only use White Hat techniques because websites using Black Hat techniques a=
ctually get penalized and deliberately assigned poor rankings by the search e=
ngines when discovered.=20

Stay the Course!=20

It takes anywhere from four to six months to see the fruits of your SEO labo=
r and obtain a first page ranking. Using the right software to monitor progr=
ess is important so you don't lose your mind. Search engines have to evaluat=
e millions upon millions of websites and they are always adjusting the metho=
d to their madness, so be patient. SEO is a long term strategy with a long-t=
erm and long lasting payoff when you are successful.=20

Plan Ahead=20

Since it takes four to six months to get results, it is wise to start planni=
ng for the winter. Think about the slow periods in your business and the ser=
vice your customers typically request during these times - tune ups for exam=
ple. Adjust the optimization strategy to reflect what your customers will ne=
ed in the upcoming months and you will literally be ahead of the competition=
.=20

ou on the first page within 6 months, we give you every penny back. Give us a=
 call and let us help your business grow online.
