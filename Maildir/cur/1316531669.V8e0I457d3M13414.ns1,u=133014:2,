doap.com (deploy on any platform)=20
- a more detailed explanation=20

Doap commoditizes generic cloud hosted website infrastructure and then trade=
s it for labor.  It is an ecosystem of aspiring developers, professional men=
tors, independent sales reps, and customers.

 Our customers want inexpensive, high quality websites and services, and are=
 attracted by the massive selection of themes via so many CMS's, the doap we=
bsite geo-tagging model with custom dealer locators, and of course, the pric=
e. Nicaraguans are early adopters and work on websites for around $10/hr.  a=
nd mentors enable those bright talents with minimal english to participate!

 Our sales people sell customers websites and infrastructure like email or  d=
omain names. Salespeople earn 25% and enjoy residuals on recurring services l=
ike hosting.

 Aspiring developers want access to the cloud but want it free and full stre=
ngth. Doap makes it happen.

 Mentors review jobs submitted by sales reps and delegate the work, such as '=
setup a wordpress site for customer x' to an interested student in exchange f=
or doap webserver credits.  the mentor communicates with the customer.

 Students earn 25% of all billable work completed on behalf of his/her doap e=
mployed mentor

A properly scalable cloud hosted lamp stack is extremely complex and out of r=
each for the beginning developer.  Doap aims to do something about that by p=
roviding the infrastructure and some mentoring on the latest CMS's so that a=
nyone with a basic facebook-ish knowledge of the web, can soon be building a=
nd selling web sites.

We recognize the explosion new open source Content Management System titles f=
rom complex to ultra simple have changed the way websites are built.=20

Doap has an automated learning system which includes an ever evolving list o=
f topics combined with short quizzes that are intended to convey a path of s=
tudy to the student, while at the same time, assesing capabilities of studen=
ts so that jobs which match their particular skillset will be easily identif=
ied.  Students earn 'stars' on the certifications matrix and are automatical=
ly suggested for jobs where appropriate.

Doap creates a space for editorial content about cms's.  Each CMS has a page=
 with feedback, tips, cms test-drive tool, and an auto-deployer to encourage=
 interaction between students, mentors, and the community at large. =20

We have 4 major blogs:=20
Sales reps, Graphic artist, Web designer, and Application developer.  Each f=
ocuses on the CMS in different ways. For example, the application developer t=
rack makes extensive use of github to engage with the open source community i=
n the development of CMS technology, while the sales blog announces new oppo=
rtinities to earn.
 =20
Doap combines the best of open source cms's and cloud services to deliver an=
 ultra easy to use,  flexible, self service, web hosting package.  Doap uses=
 that very infrastructure to train aspiring developers while at the same tim=
e, capitalizing the students homework.  By abstracting this labor from the c=
ustomer, Doap is creating new high quality jobs in under developed areas of t=
he world. (see attached nicaragua case study)
