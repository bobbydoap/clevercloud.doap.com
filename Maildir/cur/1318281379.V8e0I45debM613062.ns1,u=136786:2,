Nevermind, I just read this.  I didn't understand what the invoice was for.
Convectek is Trane.  I don't want to move forward with an adwords campaign
for Convectek.  I would like to get an ongoing service estimate for all the
Ruud dealers Dave set up last go round.  How much money will it cost monthly
to generate leads for all the Ruud dealers?
