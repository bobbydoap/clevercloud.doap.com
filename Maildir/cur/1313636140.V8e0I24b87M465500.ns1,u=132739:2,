I'm running about 60/month right now. One venture I am working on is a 
small startup of about 10 people 7 of which are sales! The business 
model is sales get commision and I get profit sharing. So as the company 
grows checks just show up in my mailbox. It is pretty sweet since 
everything is done in the cloud I could work from anywhere and the 
checks roll in!
