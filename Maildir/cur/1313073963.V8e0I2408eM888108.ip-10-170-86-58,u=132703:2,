Hey team=2C

We're going to do a live sales call to "Bay Area Plumbing & Heating"  This =
is a hot lead provided by Lauras hvac marketing group.  We will be trying t=
o reach Lance at 650 642 0551.  I encourage you all to be on the call so yo=
u can get an idea of how to do this going forward.  (he probalby wont answe=
r the first call but thats the deal...)

I'm told he 'wants to start over'=2C hates existing stuff=2C wants user fri=
endly and ability to take appointments.  What solutions would you guys offe=
r him?  I think he needs his existing domain name migrated to a basic CMS b=
acked website with an appointment page.   Also hosting and 24/7 support pac=
kage.  I'm thinking it should be worth $1000 and $20/mo. and maybe even onl=
ine advertising budget.
