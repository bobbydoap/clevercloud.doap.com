> Hi
>=20
> Can we help you in several simple ways so you can help everyone?
> EG with auto video embedding http://www.WEBiversity.org/ & more using the h=
ttp://www.TRAIDmark.org/ business structure? Ed http://www.whymandesign.com/=
 More at http://www.whymandesign.posterous.com/
>=20
>=20
> For example can we give free (recycled) books away to your customers (that=
 cost 10 pence per book) as a reward for shopping at your shops? This create=
s customer loyalty and helps entertain, educate and empower everyone to help=
 everyone as we all continually learn from books. By giving away the free bo=
oks the customers are then more likely to spend more on products so you gain=
 more profits form this (and we collect donations for charity at the same ti=
me:)
>=20
> I love your website and was hoping we could help you raise awareness of yo=
ur services AND save lives by creating free or open source charity applicati=
ons using part of your great code/app's (we can do the branding/marketing of=
 this which benefits your organisation and would like to partner with you to=
 use your technology).
>=20
> I was hoping we could work with you to use an open source version of your s=
oftware/s to create charity run services (with many beneficial reasons). Wou=
ld it be possible to work with your team and your software as part of your C=
harity CSR to do this (which will save lives:)
>=20
> One example of a video embed website is below (that may brighten up your d=
ay:)
>=20
> We made the prototype at http://www.WEBiversity.org but would like to work=
 with you to make a CMS site that enables anyone to set up their own selfles=
s charity project in a couple of clicks. If you are able to do this with us l=
ets get this up and running asap. (essentially a Drupal/Joomla site:) There a=
re some exciting Drupal add on modules being released so we would like to us=
e this. Are you able to set up Drupal sites? And what is your cost to do so (=
can you set up the site in a week at what cost using the existing free Drupa=
l modules?)? (we are a volunteer group but have collected donations that we c=
an use to fund this).
>=20
> With the up to 99% of failure in the commercial startup arena (often hidde=
n) I am very interested in helping anyone help anyone with selfless collabor=
ation platforms (that share/save/build on failure:) that empower people.
>=20
> http://www.WEBiversity.org is a very primitive example and I would love to=
 work with your team to make an open source (Drupal) website very cheaply an=
d quickly.
>=20
> Do you know any programmers I can work with on innovative charity startups=
 that will enable everyone to help everyone (easily and cheaply using open s=
ource software:)? Can we work with you on making a Drupal Open source Educat=
ion Crowdsource website EG http://www.WEBiversity.org
>=20
>=20
> Below is a LOT more information and detail about how I would like to help e=
nhance your great work by helping everyone...
>=20
>=20
> A.
> I can significantly enhance your social media and have proven to do so for=
 other organisations so would love to have a chat about this on Skype any ti=
me your free. What is your Skype name? I am 'Whymandesign' on Skype. I would=
 love to help enahance your UI/X and Social Media design/strategy too.
>=20
> B.
> Can we help enhance your work so you can help as many people as possible (=
so they can help everyone by making selfless charity startups http://www.TRA=
IDmark.org explains more:)
>=20
> I just put new video's on http://www.WEBiversity.org that you will like:)
>=20
> C.
> Is it possible to work with you to make a charity startup (so we can help e=
veryone help everyone AND benefit from the MASSIVE goodwill created by runni=
ng it as a charity)?
>=20
>=20
> Also
>=20
>=20
>=20
> I love your work and was hoping I could work with your team to creatively e=
nhance it EG in these ways...
>=20
> 1.
> Auto Embedding video in each page.
>=20
> 2.
> Registering and running as a charity (you benefit in many ways so you can g=
row as big as Wikipedia & Mozilla and get rich with performance pay!) http:/=
/www.TRAIDmark.org explains more?
>=20
> 3.
> Can we develop WEBiversity with you? We just updated http://www.WEBiversit=
y.org with a few favorite video's that you may like (and it shows how existi=
ng video can be used to try to inspire anyone to help everyone:)
>=20
> 4.
> Would you like to work with a team over a weekend to create a drupal site s=
o that any person or charity can use it to easily and quickly get inspired (=
we have limited funding but are trying to set this up on an almost zero budg=
et to show that anyone can create useful things without large funds) and run=
 a charitable project.
>=20
> Can we help you help everyone by making a charity crowdsource website that=
 enables everyone to help each other start charitable work? http://www.WEBiv=
ersity.org is the prototype. Do you know anyone who would be interested in h=
elping others in this way (or a better way to do this)?
>=20
> Please do post your comment or inspiring video's at http://www.WEBiversity=
.org AND http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=3D352077702670 so we can help=
 everyone help everyone
>=20
>=20
> EVEN more details below...
>=20
> It could be very exciting to enhance your great work by running it as a ch=
arity (that donates/invests surplus funds into NEW INNOVATIVE CHARITABLE wor=
k so literally becomes a life saver:) so high earners can donate with taxabl=
e giving  and donate surplus resources/skills/contacts adding to your goodwi=
ll so you gain the cumulative mass needed to survive (which in turn makes ev=
eryone involved rich with performance pay:). http://www.TRAIDmark.org explai=
ns more.
>=20
> Could we implement this on a trial basis within your organisation by runni=
ng the Social Media part as a charity. This has several GIANT benefits as it=
 raises awareness and Goodwill while enhancing your CSR which enables you to=
 make MORE money from your proven existing services. This is the kind of ope=
n minded innovation I am able to make that creates exponential growth.
>=20
> 1.
> Can we help enhance your work with UX Design & Social media skills?
>=20
> 2.
> Can you run as a not for profit / charity? This will help you get donation=
s to fund your development and the cumulative mass needed to survive. http:/=
/www.TRAIDmark.org explains the full benefits of doing so which enable you t=
o get rich with performance pay.
>=20
> 3.
> Can we enhance your work by creating a crowdsource charity site using pion=
eering open source modules with you? This will enable everyone to work toget=
her on charity projects.
>=20
> We are also aiming to use the site to collect donated funds for
> charity by using a re skinned version of different software for
> charitable use as a not for profit? Could you use the
> http://www.TRAIDmark.org business model?
>=20
> 4.
> Would it be possible to work with you to make a re skinned

>=20
