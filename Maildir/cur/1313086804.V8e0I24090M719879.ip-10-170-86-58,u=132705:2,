Hi Lance=2C
It was great speaking with you today!  Lets get your online presence into s=
hape.  It's really a painless process once we work out what you need.
Here's what i propose:
1yr full package w/ advertising option
includes:We will work with you=2C supplying all the coding and graphics wor=
k needed to get your 5 page site in a state that you are happy with.  The p=
rocess goes something like this...
We  introduce you to the wordpress content management system and get you co=
mfortable enought to select a theme that looks appealing to you. (its easy=
=2C just need to know what you like..)I will use the new theme and your exi=
sting landing page to create a nice 5 page site with easy to use menus and =
management tools drawing from existing HVAC sites.  Next i get your feedbac=
k for revision=2C graphics=2C page titles=2C service areas=2C fonts=2C back=
ground colors=2C meta tags for your geographic target areas=2C keywords=2C =
etc will get tweaked in this phase.We will also craft nice seasonal landing=
 pages (summer winter) with eye-catching ads which you can swap out as need=
ed per your recommendations:  http://airandplumbing.gets-it.net/When you ar=
e happy with the everything (at this point the new site will be at bahp.the=
hvac.net)=2C we will handle your bahp.com DNS switchover to our cloud based=
 web host.  You will need to provide registrar credentials for us to do thi=
s transfer for you...If you opt for advertising=2C we now get to turn on th=
e ad campaign!  Minimum recommended is $200/mo.  Best would be around $600/=
mo.  None is actually necessary but highly recommended and you can cancel a=
nytime.
The service I'm recommending is a full service package from The HVAC Networ=
k.  Setup costs $1000 and gets you all your hosting and 24/7 support for a =
year.  Advertising costs will be billed monthly as employed.

The basic deal:
core site setup with up to 10hrs custom work.24/7 support for a year.hostin=

 support.  Graphics and programming will be billed at a metered rate of $50=
