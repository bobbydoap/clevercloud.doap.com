Hey Larry,

Good to talk to ya... :)   I forgot to ask you about your GHVAC parts list.
I have a trane parts catalog all done that i got from the trane site way
back when, but not one from GHVAC.  I still need the data for that project.

Also...

Here is a prototype of the weather lookup table.  Sometimes it shows errors
on some of the weather look ups because all the weather lookups overload
it.  i will put a timer in it so it loads over a minute or so and then no
data will be missing.  its a prototype after all.  You will get the idea
immediately.  We just decide on parameters to start and stop ad campaigns
based on weather temp thresholds per area... Check it out.

https://docs.google.com/a/thehvac.net/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjFG-o3c6-KTdHh5V19NSkdqNnVnRV82aHVYQmV4V2c&hl=en_US#gid=0

2 more things...

1. your current email globlhvac.com ... how is it being handled? managed?
we need to be careful not to disrupt it when we move globalhvac.com to
globalhvac.net

and

2. a way to approve IT jobs more efficiently....  Laura is concerned it is
getting to be too many tasks and we dont want a jumble or sour grapes :)

so to head it off at the pass, i thought a IT request form was in order.

https://sites.google.com/a/thehvac.net/global-hvac-distriubtors-employee-site/it-help-desk

The form is available on ghvac-employees.com under IT Help Desk and can be
filled out by any GHVAC employee.  The request goes straight to you via an
email to larry@globalhvac.net which forwards to your sbcglobal account.  You
need to forward those requests to us here at tech@doap.com so my guys can
get the work done and billed properly. Each email request you receive will
include details of the job and the price for the work.  If you want to do
some kind of straight $50/hr thing thats fine but laura said you prefer per
job method.  (i'd also be open to a salary... hint hint.)

So i'm getting that all setup now.  Watch for teset emails in your inbox.
We just billed 7 new ruud campaign city setups at 100 each yesterday  I'm
going to fill out the IT request notification and hopefully you can verify
receipt and approval by forwarding it off to us here at tech@doap.com .

I've been pretty thorough with permissions and setup for you but there will
no doubt be some permissions that need adusting as you, the pioneers onboard
so bear with me.

Thoughts?

Thanks
