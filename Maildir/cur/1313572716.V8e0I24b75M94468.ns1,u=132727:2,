New - AWS GovCloud (US) Region - ITAR Compliant

Posted: 16 Aug 2011 01:52 PM PDT
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~3/d1-JX3qA0PE/new-aws-govcloud-us-region.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email


A New Region
Our new AWS GovCloud (US) Region was designed to meet the unique regulatory  
requirements of the United States Government. The US federal government,  
state and local governments, and the contractors who support their mission  
now have access to secure, flexible, and cost-effective AWS services  
running in an environment that complies with US Government regulations for  
processing of sensitive workloads and storing sensitive data as described  
below.

The AWS GovCloud (US) Region supports the processing and storage of  
International Traffic in Arms (ITAR) controlled data and the hosting of  
ITAR controlled applications. As you may know, ITAR stipulates that all  
controlled data must be stored in an environment where logical and physical  
access is limited to US Persons (US citizens and permanent residents). This  
Region (and all of the AWS Regions) also provides FISMA Moderate controls.  
This means that we have completed the implementation of a series of  
controls and have also passed an independent security test and evaluation.  
Needless to say, it also supports existing security controls and  
certifications such as PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and SAS 70.

To demonstrate that GovCloud complies with ITAR, we have commissioned a  
third-party review of the ITAR compliance program for AWS GovCloud (US) and  
have received a favorable letter of attestation with respect to the stated  
ITAR objectives.

The Details
The new Region is located on the west coast of the US.

All EC2 instances launched within this Region must reside within a Virtual  
Private Cloud (VPC). In addition to Amazon EC2, the following services are  
now available:

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Amazon CloudWatch
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)


If you are currently using one of the other AWS Regions, I'd like you to  
take note of one really important aspect of this release:
Other than the restriction to US persons and the requirement that EC2  
instances are launched within a VPC, we didn't make any other changes to  
our usual operational systems or practices. In other words, the security  
profile of the existing Regions was already up to the task of protecting  
important processing and data. In effect, we simply put a gateway at the  
door -- "Please show your passport or green card before entering."

You can read more about our security processes, certifications, and  
accreditations in the AWS Security Center.

Full pricing information is available on the new GovCloud (US) page.

AWS in Action
I recently learned that more than 100 federal, state, and local government  
agencies are already using AWS in various ways. Here are some examples:

The US Treasury's Recovery Accountability and Transparency board hosts  
recovery.gov on AWS (case study). The newest version of treasury.gov is  
also hosted on AWS (press release).
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory processes telemetry data and high  
resolution images on an array of EC2 cluster compute instances (case study).


The AWS Federal Government page contains a number of additional case  
studies and use cases.

Getting Access
Agencies with a need to access the AWS GovCloud must sign an AWS GovCloud  
(US) Enterprise Agreement. We will also make this Region accessible to  
government contractors, software integrators, and service providers with a  
demonstrated need for access. Those of you in this category will need to  
meet the requirements set out in ITAR Regulation 120.15.

Help Wanted
The AWS team enjoys taking on large, complex challenges to deliver new   
services, features, and regions to our customers. A typical release   
represents the combined efforts of a multitude of developers, testers,   
writers, program managers, and business leaders.

If you would like to work on large, complicated offerings such as AWS  
GovCloud, we'd love to talk to you. Here's a small sampling of our current  
job postings (there's a full list on the AWS careers page):

Software Development Engineer
IT Security Software Development Engineer
Application Security Engineer
Security Engineer
Program Manager
Amazon Web Services Public Sector Compliance Manager


-- Jeff;

PS - As you might be able to guess from the name of this Region, we would  
be interested in talking to other sovereign nations about their cloud  
computing needs.
