Elastic Load Balancer SSL Support Options

Posted: 30 Aug 2011 08:31 PM PDT
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~3/2Ogl6Ux8udw/elastic-load-balancer-ssl-support-options.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email


Weve added some additional flexibility to Amazon EC2s Elastic Load  
Balancing feature:

You can now terminate SSL sessions at the load balancer and then re-encrypt  
them before they are sent to the back-end EC2 instances.
You can now configure the set of ciphers and SSL protocols accepted by the  
load balancer.
You can now configure HTTPS health checks.


Terminate and Re-Encrypt
The Elastic Load Balancer has supported SSL for a while. Heres the original  
model:


Were enhancing this feature to allow you to terminate a request at the load  
balancer and then re-encrypt it before it is sent to an EC2 instance:


This provides additional protection for your data, a must for PCI  
compliance, among other scenarios. As a bonus feature, the Elastic Load  
Balancer can now verify the authenticity of the EC2 server before sending  
the request. By allowing the ELB to handle the termination and  
re-encryption, developers can now take advantage of features like session  
affinity (sticky sessions) while still using HTTPS.

You can set this up from the AWS Management Console, the Command Line  
tools, or the Elastic Load Balancer APIs.

Configurable Ciphers
You may not know it, but SSL can use a variety of different algorithms  
(also known as ciphers) to encrypt and decrypt requests and responses. The  
algorithms vary in the level of protection that they offer and in the  
computational load required to do the work.

Developers have told us that they need additional control over the set of  
ciphers used by their Load Balancers. In some cases they need to support  
archaic clients using equally archaic ciphers. More commonly, they want to  
use only the most recent ciphers as part of a compliance effort. For  
example, they might want to stick with 256 bit AES, a cipher that the US  
Government has approved for the protection of top secret information.

You can now control the set of ciphers that each of your Load Balancers  
presents to its clients. You can do this using the command-line tools, the  
APIs, or the AWS Management Console:


HTTPS Health Checks
You can (and definitely should) configure your Load Balancers to perform  
periodic health checks on the EC2 instances under their purview. Up until  
now these health checks had to be done via HTTP. As of this release, you  
can now configure HTTPS health checks. This means that you can configure  
your instances such that they respond only to requests on port 443.

Keep Going
Read more about these new features in the Elastic Load Balancing Developer  
Guide.
