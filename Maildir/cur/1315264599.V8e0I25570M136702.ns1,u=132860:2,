I have what he sent me in his email.  It is just not what we want.  I guess I=
 didn't look closely at his work product.  He fixed the snowflake error but I=
 don't even remember where that error came from originally.   Regardless, I'=
m redoing it.   It would have to get done sometime and you've  already paid.=
  It's really not a big deal to redo.

Re the video, it really depends on what you want. How long will it be?  How m=
any segments do you want joined?  Backgrounds? Effects?  I'm not comfortable=
 giving you a price.  Somewhere in the $200 ballpark ok?  If you really like=
 it you can tip me, and if it sucks, dont pay.

Cheers amigo
