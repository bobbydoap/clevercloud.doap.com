Powerful New Features for AWS CloudFormation

Posted: 29 Sep 2011 11:49 PM PDT
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~3/c7dBtFuVr1o/powerful-new-features-for-aws-cloudformation.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email




Ive been making a point of telling my live audiences about AWS  
CloudFormation lately. Many large-scale AWS customers are starting to  
appreciate the fact that they can describe and instantiate entire  
application stacks using parameterized templates (see my original  
CloudFormation blog post for more info), allowing them to create a  
repeatable process around it.

Today we are adding some powerful new features to CloudFormation to give  
you additional control over the resource creation process. We have also  
added some new application bootstrapping features that will give you full  
control of the configuration of each EC2 instance launched by a template.

Heres what is new:

Template Composition - Your CloudFormation templates can now reference  
other templates by URL. This looks like a parameterized function call in a  
procedural programming language (although CloudFormation templates are  
declarative). You can use this feature to create a series of reusable  
templates, each with a specific responsibility, such as installing a  
particular package or setting up an architectural component such as a load  
balancer or a database.

IAM Integration - Your CloudFormation templates can now specify the  
creation of IAM (Identity and Access Management) users, groups, and the  
associated policies. Existing CloudFormation functions provide you with  
access to attributes of the users, including access keys and secret access  
keys. Like all other resources created by a CloudFormation template, the  
users, groups, and policies are associated with the application stack and  
will be deleted when the stack is deleted, unless you explicitly choose to  
retain them.

Stack Updating - You can now update a running CloudFormation stack by  
supplying an updated template. CloudFormation will carefully update the  
resources in the stack to match the new template. Resources that are  
unchanged will be left as-is. Resources with changed attributes will be  
updated "in-place" if possible, and replaced only as a last resort.  
CloudFormation supports updating of the following resource types:  
AutoScaling Groups and Launch Configurations, CloudWatch Alarms, EC2  
Instances, Load Balancers, DB Instances, and Route 53 RecordSets. Read more  
about stack updating.

Application Bootstrapping - You now have a wide variety of options to  
bootstrap (install and configure) the applications on each EC2 instance  
that you launch. You can continue to create "golden images" -- static AMIs  
that contain the OS and the application, all pre-configured and ready to  
go. Or, you can choose between any of the following four new options:

Running a shell script at boot time using the CloudInit package from  
Canonical. The shell script is passed to the instance using EC2s user data  
facility.
Encoding configuration meta-data in the CloudFormation template and  
accessing the metadata using a set of CloudFormation helper scripts running  
on the instance. You can use the cfn-init script to download and unpack  
archive fles, install packages, create and populate files, and configure  
services.
Configuring the instance using Chef from Opscode. Configuration data  
(cookbooks) can be supplied locally (Chef Solo), from a Chef server, or  
from Hosted Chef.To learn more about this option, read our new document,  
Integrating AWS CloudFormation with Opscode Chef.
Storing the configuration on a Puppet Master server and then configuring  
the instance a using Puppet Client from Puppet Labs. To learn more about  
this option, read our new document, Integrating AWS CloudFormation with  
Puppet.


We have put together a guide to Bootstrapping Applications via AWS  
CloudFormation. This document outlines all four approaches to application  
bootstrapping.

You will learn about the pros and cons of each approach to bootstrapping,  
and you will learn how to implement each one of them.

We have added two new sections to the existing documentation. Check out the  
Getting Started Walkthrough and learn about the Template Basics. We have  
also updated the AWS CloudFormation User Guide with new sections on getting  
started and on learning the basics of using templates.

If you have been statically configuring your instances (or your physical   
servers), the move to a more dynamic, declarative model is a pretty big   
change. My advice: Spend your time learning to do this the right way  now,  
and then benefit from it for years to come! Learning how to set up  servers  
dynamically is at least as worthwhile as learning a new  programming  
language or a new text editor!

Amazon CloudFront & Route 53 - New Edge Location: Brazil

Posted: 29 Sep 2011 11:34 PM PDT
http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AmazonWebServicesBlog/~3/mRAcuSE0LKs/amazon-cloudfront-new-edge-location-brazil.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email




We've just added an edge location in Brazil (number 20 to be precise) to  
Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53. This is our first edge location in  
South America.

The new location will speed up references to static and streamed content  
that are made from locations in South America, and will also accelerate the  
resolution of DNS queries that originate from within the area.

The CloudFront location in Brazil supports the entire array of CloudFront  
features including streaming media (both on demand and live), invalidation,  
custom origins,  Identity & Access Management, request logging, and private  
content.



Our customers have put CloudFront to use in a variety of ways. Check out  
our case studies from the likes of IMDB, PBS, Playfish, Second Life, and  
Virgin Atlantic to learn more. It is very easy to get started with  
CloudFront. Once you have done so, your content will be available more  
quickly, your application will be more responsive, and your users will be  
happier!

  Now Hiring
The CloudFront team continues to grow and we have a number of open  
positions including Account Manager (Herndon, Virginia), Business  
Development Manager (Luxembourg),  Enterprise Sales Representative (New  
York), Enterprise Sales Representative (Seattle), Software Development  
Engineer (Seattle), Senior Systems Engineer (Seattle), Senior Software  
Development Manager (Seattle), and more.

<p>We've just added an edge location in <strong>Brazil</strong> (number 20 =
to be precise) to <a href=3D"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target=3D"_=

target=3D"_self">Amazon Route 53</a>. This is our first edge location in So=
uth America.</p>
<p>The new location will speed up references to static and streamed content=
 that are made from locations in South America, and will also accelerate th=
e resolution of DNS queries that originate from within the area.</p>
